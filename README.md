# Red Wine Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict red wine quality based on various chemical attributes, aiming to assist winemakers in evaluating quality control. It includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and scales features for improved model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes relationships between wine attributes and quality, visualizing significant patterns.
3. **Model Training:** Trains several algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Compares models using accuracy, precision, and recall to identify the best performer.
